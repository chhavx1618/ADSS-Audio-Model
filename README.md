# ADSS-Audio-ML-Model

A Machine Learning model that process the audio recorded during an emergency or SOS.

## Introduction to the Audio Model

The Audio model takes text input from the ADSS application and process what is being said in the situation. The Model has been trained to recognize various statements that can be classified as threats. It is trained to give output in 0, 1 or 2 according to what text input it is receiving. For example, when it recognizes a threatening statement, the model sends output in accordance to the input. The output is then used in further security sequences. 

## Features

#### 1. Taking text input
The Model accepts text input, in english (for now), that is being sent to it by the ADSS application. 
   
#### 2. Processing text input
The Model has been trained to process what text input it receives and to classify the threat going on into varying levels. It has been trained with multiple statements to make sure that it gives high accuracy of recognition of statements.
   
#### 3. Classifying threat levels
The Models classifies the level of threat and reports back accordingly so that necessary actions can be taken.

## Future Goals

1. To train our Model to recognize threats in multiple languages

2. Make the model more versatile

3. Allow the Model to recognize even more common phrases, series of phrases, and less used words as well.
